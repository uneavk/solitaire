 cards, there are spaces for 7 reserve columns. On the right side,\n\
 there are spaces for 4 base columns where the starting cards\n\
 are the cards of the same value as the first card placed in any\n\
 base column. The remaining 3 cards are placed in the stock\n\
 pile. The goal is to collect all the cards on the base columns\n\
 in ascending sequential order in suit. Moving the top cards of play\n\
 columns from one play column to another is allowed in descending\n\
 sequential order in suit. Any cards from the play columns can be\n\
 moved to the reserve columns,and from the reserve columns to the\n\
 base columns. Each reserve column should contain no more than\n\
 one card. If any of the play columns are freed from cards,any card\n\
 from the stock pile can be placed in the empty space.\n\n\
 Solitaire is won when all cards are collected on the base\n\
 columns in ascending sequential order in suit.")
